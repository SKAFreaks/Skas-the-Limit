# Skas-the-Limit

Something something RJ's getting the band back together. 


-er, just together. It hasn't been made for the first time yet. 


The point is, RJ is cool and I'm glad that he's in my life. 


If you're not comfortable using the Ren'py SDK, then good luck trying to get this to run lol. 


I'm pretty sure there's a way to automatically have github build it for us.....


But I'm too lazy to do that now.


Any builds released will be released... later.
